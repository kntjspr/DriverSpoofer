# DriverSpoofer
DriverSpoofer allows you to spoof windows drivers parameters for anonymity/privacy.


# Objectives
Websites nowadays can detect what is your system information including the amount of microphones and webcams and whether you're using a virtual or real ones. The problem here is that they know when you spoof those things by looking at the driver parameters.

Screenshot 1: I already spoofed OBS Virtual camera and renamed it into "Logitech Streamcam"

Screenshot 2: But that spoofing method didn't work. It still shows OBS Cam. why? It looks at your device manager parameters.
