# DriverSpoofer
DriverSpoofer is a utility that generates falsified driver data to prevent privacy-invading websites from gathering your device data without actually being detected. 

## Information
Websites may now detect system information such as the number of microphones and webcams you have and whether they are virtual or real.
The problem is that they can determine when you're lying by analyzing the driver parameters.
When your machine is discovered as having virtual cameras or a spoofing device installed, certain websites (usually anti-fraud algorithms) will flag it as fraudalent.  

Screenshot 1: I've previously spoofed OBS Virtual camera and renamed it "Logitech Streamcam" using ![conventional techniques.](https://github.com/LudoDash/Obs-VCam-Changer)

Screenshot 2: However, the spoofing strategy did not work. OBS Cam has still been detected by the website, why? because it examines the driver parameters.
